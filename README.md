# TiddlyWikis as Plugins

Source : https://github.com/chris2fr/tiddlywikis-as-plugins/

TiddlyWikis as Plugins is a TiddlyWiki plugin to automagically manage content from TiddlyWiki wikis as plugins themselves.

## For now

This is an additional export filter. Save the file as a .tld, for example for "All Tiddlers" in the side-menu. Save the file. Import the file into another Wiki.

To configure, please change the variables in $:/plugins/mannfr/twaap/config.

For example, to create this plugin, I did an advanced search with the filter "[tag[TiddlyWikiAsAPlugin]]" and then simply exported the results as a plugin.
